## Laravel Ecommerce app source code

It feels more right to me to encapsulate this functionality on the model instead of using some wrapper class which feels more like functional programming and not very OOP oriented.
*    before running locally, a folder called **local** must be created within the config folder. After that you should create a **database.php** config file and specify the MySQL connections. Once done, run DB migrations through artisan
